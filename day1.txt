nmap or network mapper is a open source tool that is used to scan the ip addresses and port

The command I am going to use is
$ nmap -sS ip-addresses

This command gives me the output of the all the available system ports that are available in my system 
To run this command I need to provide the system administration privilges

I use the win 11 operating system so I needed to manually install the nmap and npcap

npcap is the open source tool that is used to the packet sniffing in the windows operating system

Pakcket sniffing is the process of inspecting the data packets as they travel across the computer network

when I run the above command I got the output in this manner

RESULTS:

Starting Nmap 7.97 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-23 12:35 +0530
Nmap scan report for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Host is up (0.00007s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
135/tcp  open  msrpc
137/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
xxxx/tcp open  icslap

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.05 seconds

The common services that are running on the ports are

msrpc is Microsoft Remote Procedure call that will be running on the port 135/tcp and 135/udp
It allows the client applications to communicate with server-side like the DCOM,Exchange server

netbios-ssn or NetBIOS Session Service it is used for the printer sharing on the windows over the TCP/IP protocol
it is operates on the port 137

Microsoft-DS it is used to file sharing,printer access,remote admin login and etc it works on the port 445/tcp 

The ports are very sensitive to the attacks so we need to block them from the internet using the firewall

So using the nmap -sS ip-adress-of-local-system we can scan this ports
