In this I have taken the Gmail Login Attempt Blocked email from the caniphish.com

The email headers are from 
google-support@webnotifications.net

The senders email address looks like a genuiune google mail


The header I analysed it using the caniphish

The hops for the suspicious-domain.com is set to automatic
The hops for the mx.example.com is getting the delays of 5 seconds


The suspicious links that are in the gmail is the links that gives the button
which will redirect to the an duplicate gmail and password sign in page

It says that to urgently login back to stop the suspension of your google account 
This above statement is the urgent language

I could note that the check activity button redirects to the custom made
gmail login page not the authentic one

I could not find any grammatical errors in them


The summary of the email
    The email creates a sense of urgence in the user to stop their google accounts from stoping them from being get
    suspended so they create the urgence by providing the check activity button link which will redirect them back
    to the custom gmail login page where the user if enters the email and password it will post the email and password
    to the scammer

This is the end of Day2 :)
